# Lip cancer

Here is the lip cancer data given to you in terribly unreproducible and error-prone format. 

- `aff.i` is proportion of male population working outside in each region
- `observe.i` is observed deaths in each region
- `expect.i` is expected deaths, based on region-specific age distribution and national-level age-specific mortality rates. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
observe.i <- c(

## Question 1

Run three different models in Stan with three different set-up's for estimating $\theta_i$, that is the relative risk of lip cancer in each region:

1. $\theta_i$ is same in each region $= \theta$
2. $\theta_i$ is different in each region and modeled separately
3. $\theta_i$ is different in each region and modeled hierarchically

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# First repare a data-frame w/ all data
N <- length(observe.i)
dt <- data.frame (region = 1:N,
                  y = observe.i,
                  e = expect.i,
                  xc = aff.i-mean(aff.i))

# Observed SMR
SMRObs <- dt$y/dt$e

```

\textbf{Model 0} - $\theta_i$ is same in each region $= \theta$

```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
